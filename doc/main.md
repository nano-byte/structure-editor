This website documents the API of the [NanoByte.StructureEditor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NanoByte.StructureEditor/) NuGet package.

NanoByte Structure Editor is a WinForms library that helps you build split-screen editors for your data structures, consisting of:

1. a collapsible tree-view of the data structure,
2. a graphical editor for the currently selected element in the tree (PropertyGrid or custom) and
3. a text editor (based on [ICSharpCode.TextEditor](https://github.com/nano-byte/ICSharpCode.TextEditor)) with a serialized (XML, JSON, etc.) representation of the currently selected element.

This allows you to create an IDE-like experience for your users when editing complex domain specific languages, configuration files, etc..

This library is available for .NET Framework 2.0+.
